1. Import the torchvision  pandas,numpy,and matplot libraries.
2.we load the Dakshina dataset in drive .
3.we did the data preprocessing part using  dropna,and created Tokens for both train test data sets.
4.tokens converted to the vocabulary characters
5charaters  coveted to tensors  train and test dataset of Dakshina .
6 we loaded the tensors in dataloader
7.we created a LSTM model with encoder ,decoder ,seq2seq  number of cell =2 
8.we train  model for  different hyperparameter
